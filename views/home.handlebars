        <h3>From the beginning, sport has been a tool of the ruling class to
            maintain power; a form of base entertainment—<em>a barbaric
                spectacle</em>—to keep the masses dumb and satisfied.</h3>
        <br />
        <h3>Early iterations were bloody, not far removed from their military
            origins. It comes as no surprise that sport is one the main drivers
            of nationalism, racism, and other forms of tribalism today.</h3>
        <br />
        <h3>Sport remains the most effective tool of the wealthy to maintain the
            current power structure: capitalism. The cutthroat nature of sport
            reflects the death spiral that is rampant capitalism, with only a
            few winners (the wealthy) and vast numbers of losers (the poor).</h3>
        <br />
        <h3>Sport and the industry built around it is a moral blight upon this
            earth.</h3>
